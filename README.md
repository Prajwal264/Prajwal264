## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Prajwal, a self taught Front end developer and an aspiring Full stack developer. I've worked on many projects on web.

Software engineering has been my muse since childhood. Even though I've taken the path less trodden, it hasn't stopped me from moving ahead, towards the fulfillment of my goals.
